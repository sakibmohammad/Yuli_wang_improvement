## Using AI to generate traction maps and predict substrate stiffness for single cell traction force microscopy

Summary of the project:

This project aims to predict single cell traction forces and substrate stiffness from phase image and/or bead displacement vectors, and cell area/shape. We cultured HeLa cells on substrate of two different stiffness and did the traction force microscopy (TFM) on them to generate the ground truth and used these data to train AI models. We used tree-based machine learning (ML) models and convolutional neural network (CNN) based deep learning (DL) models to obtain our goals. Both models were able to accurately predict the desired outcome. There were some shortcomings, however, owing to the tiny dataset and scarcity of computational resources to train complex DNN models. But the ideas can be extended to obtain meaningful results if sufficient resources are available.
